USER STORY:

As a inquisitive traveller, I want to know general country 
information and pertinent COVID-19 data from that country 
so I can stay informed on the pandemic status of a country 
I may visit. 

As a user, when I enter a country into the form, I am presented 
with pertinent country information (population, flag, language, 
currency). 

As a user, when I enter a country into the form, I am presented 
with past and current COVID-19 data. 

I want the list of countries I have previously searched to display on the page.
